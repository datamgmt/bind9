These are the files for testing the PAY Bind configuration

They are currently hard coded to /usr/local and overwrite whatever is there

They can be installed with

sudo contrib/pay/cpcfg

Files are copied from contrib/pay/cfgfiles to /usr/local 
The cp is verbose in order to show what is being copied
